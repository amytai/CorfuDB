/**
 * This interface represents the simplest type of stream unit.
 * Write once stream units provide these simple features:
 *
 * Write, which takes an address and payload and returns success/failure
 *          It is guranteed that any address once written to is immutable (write-once)
 * Read, which takes an address and returns a payload, or an error if
 *          nothing exists at that address.
 * Trim, which takes some offset and marks all addresses before, inclusive, as trimmed.
 *          Trimmed addresses return a trimmed error when written to or read from.
 *
 * All methods are synchronous, that is, they block until successful completion
 * of the command.
